# Documentation Index

This directory is the durable knowledge base for Gen Code. Keep `README.md`
concise, use `AGENTS.md` as the short navigation map, and put lasting
explanations here.

## Primary Entrypoints

- `../README.md` — product overview, installation, usage.
- `../AGENTS.md` — short agent and contributor navigation guide.
- `architecture.md` — system-level overview and primitives.
- `packages/index.md` — per-package design pages.
- `concepts/index.md` — cross-cutting concept pages.
- `operations/development.md` — local development workflow.

## By Reader Goal

### Understand the system

- `architecture.md` — primitives, runtime model, layer model.
- `packages/` — one page per Go package; each has a Contract section with
  the package's public Go interface.
- `concepts/` — cross-cutting concepts that span multiple packages
  (data flow, rendering, extension model, harness channels,
  permission model).

### Look up a fact

- `reference/slash-commands.md` — all slash commands.
- `reference/configuration.md` — config files and field reference.
- `reference/dependency-rules.md` — layer / import rules.
- `reference/package-map.md` — package-to-layer assignment.
- `reference/claude-permission-compat.md` — Claude-Code-compatible
  permission rule syntax.
- `reference/token-limits.md`, `reference/cost-tracking.md`,
  `reference/cli-startup.md`, `reference/loop.md`,
  `reference/file-naming.md`, `reference/minmax-provider.md`.

### Do something

- `guides/explore-mode.md` — using the explore subagent.
- `operations/development.md` — build / test / lint / format.
- `operations/testing.md` — test strategy and local commands.
- `operations/release.md` — release process.
- `operations/troubleshooting.md` — common development issues.
- `operations/benchmark.md` — reproduce the benchmark numbers.

### Know why a decision was made

- `design/principles.md` — engineering principles for structure and docs.
- `design/decisions/` — architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Work-in-Progress Plans

Plans live at the repo root under `notes/` (not in `docs/`):

- `notes/active/` — active restructuring or feature plans.
- `notes/completed/` — completed plans kept for historical context.
- `notes/tech-debt.md` — known structural debt and follow-up candidates.

## Update Policy

When code changes, update the relevant package page in `packages/` in the
same pull request. When a new top-level package is added or a package
moves, update `reference/package-map.md` and `reference/dependency-rules.md`
together. New cross-cutting concept ⇒ a page in `concepts/`. New decision
⇒ an ADR in `design/decisions/`.
