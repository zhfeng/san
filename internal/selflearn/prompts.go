Reflect on it and capture only durable learnings using the write tools available to you. You are out-of-band: your writes affect future sessions, not the one above. Be conservative — "nothing to save" is a perfectly good outcome. Do not narrate to the user; do the work via tool calls.`

// advertises Bash/Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep that the fork rejects via its

// e.g. `Read('./SKILL.md')` calls that burn turns getting rejected, and the

Eviction is part of the job, not an afterthought:

1. First, scan the current store below and retire stale / superseded / merged-PR-specific entries via action=remove. A pass that only adds is a missed pruning opportunity.
2. If an existing entry covers the same topic as your new learning, use action=replace to refresh it — never add a near-duplicate.
3. The store has a hard %d KB cap per file. When the index is near cap, you MUST prune another entry first before your new add will fit.
4. Only then, action=add for the genuinely new durable fact.

Do NOT save: one-off task state, transient errors, or "what we did this session" narratives — those are not durable.`, cap)

// the per-action recap rows show "<kind · target>: <note>" — and (b)

// surfaces as "✓ <summary>". "Nothing to save." suppresses the
// user-visible recap entirely (§6 invariant #7).
const reviewClosing = `Per-call note (REQUIRED): every memory_write / skill_manage call MUST include a "note" parameter — one short clause (≤80 chars) describing what THAT specific call changed. Examples:
  - memory_write: "added 3 race-condition repro tips", "removed vague tooling guidance", "replaced outdated build-cache note"
  - skill_manage: "trimmed examples section by 1.8KB", "added type-hint cheatsheet to references/", "removed the generic intro paragraph"
The note appears verbatim in the per-action recap row, so be concrete.

Closing line: after the tool calls (or after deciding none are warranted), reply with ONE short line:
  - If no writes occurred, reply with the literal string "Nothing to save."
  - Otherwise reply with a single sentence of at most 60 characters summarising the whole pass — the key target + the gist of the edit. Examples: "trimmed go-testing SKILL.md by 1.8KB", "saved debugging notes (3 entries)", "created python-typing skill". No bullet list, no quotes, no period — just the line.

The closing line is shown verbatim in the status bar; the per-call notes are shown in the recap. Keep both concrete and brief.`
