# Contributing to GenCode

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genai-io/gen-code.git
cd gen-code
go build -o gen ./cmd/gen
./gen
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- An LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)

GOCACHE=/tmp/gocache go test ./...
```

Transcript/session focused suites:

```

Transcript storage layout, recording rules, and the event model are documented in `docs/inspector.md`.

### Debug Mode

```bash
GEN_DEBUG=1 ./gen
# Logs written to ~/.gen/debug.log
```
